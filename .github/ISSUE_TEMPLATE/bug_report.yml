              For intermittent issues, please enable debug logging by by setting `"findrelated.outputLevel": "debug"` in your `settings.json`.
              This will enable logging to the _Find Related_ channel in the _Output_ pane.

              Once enabled, please reproduce the issue, and attach the logs.
